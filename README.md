# IS Project

## Overview
This is a prototype wave-based survival first-person shooter (FPS) video game, which is the focus of the creator's Senior Independent Study for the College of Wooster's class of 2022. The main purpose of this project is to explore the processes behind designing and creating a video game. As the project progresses, there are many other features that could be explored and potentially added into the game, as detailed below. This project is made with Unity version 2021.2.0f1 and written in C#.

## Features
Currently, the game has the following features:
- Basic movement and camera control
- Basic ranged combat mechanics and weapons:
  * 3 types of firearms w/ superficial differences
  * One type of grenade
- One rudimentary map to test the various mechanics 
- Four types of enemy w/ different characteristics and a basic pathfinding algorithm
- Rudimentary enemy spawning and wave-controlling mechanics
- Basic UI

Whilst not feature-complete, these basic features provide a decent foundation for the project that can then be built upon in the future. This category will be updated as the game is further developed.

## Future
In the future, this game can be much further developed by adding more features and improving existing ones. The following is a non-exhaustive list of potential features (not ranked according to their priorities and importance):
- Improved graphics (effects, models, etc)
- Sounds (effects, background music, etc)
- More and improved UI elements
  * Main menu
  * Options
- More maps and/or procedurally generated maps
- More difficulties
- More in-game contents
  * Enemies
  * Weapons
- More mechanics:
  * Weapon shop
  * Score system
  * etc
